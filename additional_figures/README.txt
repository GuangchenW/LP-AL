This folder contains figures used in Case 1 and 2 in the experiments section (IV.A and IV.B, respectively). Files are named using the format [system]_[learning function]_[batch_size].extension. E.g. 4B_U_8.png is generated by applying LP-AL implemented with the U function on the four-branch series system, when the batch size is 8.

.png images show the estimated limit state. For more details, please see the corresponding sections in the paper.
.gif files show the points selected (red star) from the reduced sample pool (blue circles) during each iteration (indicated by the number on the bottom left).
